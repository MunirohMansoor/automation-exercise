# Automation Test for Google Search

This is the Automation Exercise for automate
google keyword search.

In this testing I'm using Selenium Webdriver and the test case was written in Python.

`Here how to test it`

1. run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. run `pytest test_google_search.py -s`

The search result(Title, URL) will display in the terminal and also in `Search Result.txt` file.
